# Predict early readmission of diabetes patients within 30 days of discharge

The objective of this analysis is to accurately (or rather, as accurately as possible) predict if a patient who was diagnosed with diabetes and who was in the hospital for at least 14 days will be readmitted within the next 30 days following discharge. The type of machine learning used in this analysis is supervised machine learning since we are trying to predict a target variable. For the sake of simplicity, we will not list all the feature variables used in this analysis (because there are so many), but before any data preprocessing or feature engineering, there were 47 data features and one target variable (readmitted) that has three possible values (no, <30, and >30). These values correspond to whether a patient was readmitted or not or when they were readmitted if they were (the patient was not readmitted in the case of 'no', the patient was readmitted within 30 days of discharge in the case of '<30" or the patient was readmitted outside of 30 days of discharge in the case of '>30'). Success will be measured by the performance metrics of the prediction algorithms.
